## Loops Practice
**Note: Do not use map, filter, or reduce, or forEach in your solutions for these prompts.

1. Create a function called `logLocationAndTime` that takes in one parameter - `array` - which represents an array of student objects like the one featured in data.js. This function should use a for loop to iterate backwards through the input array, and each iteration it should log the current student's location followed by a dash and their timezone.
```javascript
// example output
//I: a students array
//O: the student's location followed by a dash and timezone (New Orleans, LA - CST)
logLocationAndTime(students){
    //iterate BACKWARDS
    for (let i = 0; i < students.length; i++)
    //make a variable that we will console log location and time
    let local = students[i].location; 
    let zone = students[i].timeZone;
    //make a template literal to log
    let output = `${local} - ${zone}`;
        console.log(output)
}
;
/*
LOGS =>
Baltimore, MD - EST
Atlanta, GA - EST
New Orleans, LA - CST
New Orleans, LA - CST
*/
```

2. Create a function called `logHalf` that takes in one parameter - `array` - which represents an array of student objects like the one featured in data.js. This function should use a for loop to only iterate through HALF of the input array and log each student's name followed by a dash and the number of courses they have attempted and ending with two dashes. For the purposes of this function, assume the length of the input array will always be even.
```javascript
logHalf(students);
/*
LOGS =>
Stephanie Cooper
Courses attempted: 1
--
Bethany Joseph
Courses attempted: 2
--
*/
```

3. Create a function called `getStringValues` that takes in one parameter - `student` - which represents an individual student object like the ones in the students array in data.js. This function should use a for in loop to iterate through the input object and push any string values at each key that have a length longer than 3 into an output array. This function should return the output array of string values at the end.
```javascript
// example output
getStringValues(students[0]); // => [ 'Stephanie Cooper', 'New Orleans, LA'];
```

4. Create a function called `createBooleanEntries` that takes in two parameters - `array`, `name`. `array` represents an array of student objects like the one featured in data.js; `name` represents a string of an individual student's name. This function should use a for loop to iterate through the input array and find the student matching the input name. When the student is found, the function should use a for in loop to iterate through the keys that student object and create a subarray of the key and value for every property that has a boolean value attached to it. These subarrays should be pushed into an output array that is returned at the end of the function.
```javascript
// example output
createBooleanEntries(students, 'Bethany Joseph'); // => [['hotSpotAvailability', true], ['transportation', false], ['newsLetterSubscription', true]]
```

5. Create a function called `getCoursesByYear` that takes in two parameters - `array`, `year`; `array` represents an array of student objects like the one featured in data.js; `year` represents a string of a year (example: '2024'). This function should use a for loop to iterate through the input array and then use a nested for loop to iterate through each student's courses array. For each course that was last attempted in the input `year`, the function should create an object that looks like this:
```javascript
{
    studentName: <name of student>,
    course: <course name>,
    status: <status>,
    observations: <number of observations>
}
```
Each new object created should be pushed into an output array that is returned at the end of the function.
```javascript
// example output
getCourseByYear(students, '2024'); 
/*
RETURNS =>
[
    {
        studentName: 'Stephanie Cooper', 
        course: 'Prep', 
        status: 'Passed', 
        observations: 1
    },
    {
        studentName: 'Bethany Joseph', 
        course: 'Bootcamp', 
        status: 'Passed', 
        observations: 1
    },
]
*/
```
